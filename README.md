Game rules:

1. The game is played on an N x N grid, and the size of the grid is specified by the player when starting the game.
2. Two players each secretly place a landmine on the grid.
3. Players take turns to choose a "safe" position.
4. If a player selects the position of the opponent's landmine, the game ends and the player loses the match.
A position that has already been selected cannot be selected again.
6. The game continues until a player touches a landmine or has nowhere to choose.
